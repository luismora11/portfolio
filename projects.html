        <p class="card-text">  <p>The main goal for building this project was to use basic JavaScript concepts to show that I had a very good understanding
          of arrays, methods, loops and funcitons. There is a list of random string games. The first challenge was to alphabetize the list, the second challenge was to capitalize the first letter of each word in the array. I used a nested for loop to solve that problem.
          The final challenge consisted in making a random list item change color when you click a button, for this problem I used funcitons to achieve the desired outcome.<a href="https://javascriptsmallproject.netlify.app/">Visit JavaScript Small Project Website</a></p>

        <p class="card-text">  <p>Creating the Girls and Boys Club website was easy. I just had to create a navigation bar with links to additional pages containing information about the organization. 
        I went to Splash.com looking for images that could support the overall theme of the website. I have become an expert at styling images. My goal was to find a unique image for every page. I had to include the logo in the navigation mune too. It was easier than I expected. 
        For this specific project I had to use html and css. I learned a lot of new css properties. The most important thing I learned was the box model and how it works. <a href="https://boysygirls.netlify.app/index.html">Visit Girls and Boys Club Website</a></p>

        <p class="card-text">    <p>This API shows the Astronomy Picture of the day. I used the fetch() method to fetch the title, date, image and description from the Nasa API portal.
          I created an h1, p and img element using JavaScript to store the items that I retrieved from the Nasa API. I proceeded to append all of the elements to the parent element, It is a really important step because otherwise the element's content will not display.
           If you are interested to see how I built this API make sure to visit my GitHub acount where I have the repositories for this project and more.<a href="https://nasaapifetch.netlify.app/">Visit Nasa API Website</a></p>

        <p class="card-text">  <p>Creating this website was so much fun. I love Nasa, maybe that's why I had such a great time building this website. I had to find a logo and then place it where eveyone could see it. 
        The next step was to create a navigation menu where I had to add hover icons using css, to be honest it was pretty easy. 
        I had to find images from the official Nasa's website and iclude them somewhere in the page. It was just a mock-up, that's why I was allowed to use placeholder text. I love how this website looks.<a href="http://cmin.dcc.edu/users/luismorales2/proj_3/index.html">Visit Nasa's Unoffical Website</a></p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Waterman</h5>
        <p class="card-text">    <p>I was hired to create a new website for the art and history museum in Green Valley, Arizona. I had to use Boostrap - a free css library - to make the page responsive, which means that when you resize the page the content will get bigger or smaller automatically adapting to the page's width. It is a technique you have to use all the time. 
        I also created four separate pages containing information about the museum's art collection, calendar and how to help the museum. For this project I had to use all the skills I learned throughout the course. I hope I chose the right colors for this project. 
         I had to create a responsive layout that adapts to the size of the display. I learned one of the most important aspects of building websites, Media Queries include a block of css properties only if certain condition is true. While I was creating these projects I found a really cool website, Unsplash.com. It's very useful if you want to find free images to use on your projects. <a href="https://watermanngallery.netlify.app/">Visit WATERMANN Gallery Website</a></p>
